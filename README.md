- The wack-a-Mole game is a simple game developed in Java which has simple functionality where there are two images first is Mole and second is a Plant, on clicking the mole the score will increase by 10, and on clicking the plant the game will be over.

- The project has simple clicking functionality, so the read-me file is not a necessary step here.

- To run this project, you can directly create a Java class named WhacAMole and paste the code from here, or simply fork the repo. You can even download it and can open it in your favorite IDE, and run the WhacAMole.java file.
